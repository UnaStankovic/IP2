The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry has declared the Hungarian consul in Beregovo a "non-grata person" and gave him a deadline of 72 hours to leave the country.

"We hope that the Hungarian side will refrain from hostile steps towards Ukraine in the future and that its officials will not violate the Ukrainian law," the ministry said in a statement, Reuters reports.

Ukraine is dissatisfied with the fact that Hungary issues its passports to members of the Hungarian community in that country.

Hungary, in turn, expelled the Ukrainian consul in Budapest and threatened to block Ukrainian integration into the EU and NATO.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Siaarto has accused Ukraine of carrying out "an extreme campaign that spurs hatred towards the Zakarpatian Hungarians and denies that the Hungarian consul has violated the law.

He also criticized Ukraine's decision to conduct military exercises near the border with Hungary.
